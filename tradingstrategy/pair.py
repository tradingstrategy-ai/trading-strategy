"""Trading pair information and pair datasets.

The core classes to understand the data are

- :py:class:`DEXPair`: describe one trading pair on different DEXes on different blockchains

- :py:class:`PandasPairUniverse`: all available trading pairs across all blockchains
  and functions to look them up.

- :py:data:`HumanReadableTradingPairDescription`: define the format for symbolic look iup
  for trading pairs

Trading pairs are **not fungible** across DEXes and blockchains.

- The same token might have different address on a different blockchains

- The same trading pair may be on multiple DEXes, or even
  on the same DEX with different fee tiers e.g. Uniswap v3
  gives WETH-USDC at 0.05%, 0.30% and 1% fee tiers,
  most real trading happening on 0.05% tier

Here is an example how to look up a particular trading pair::

.. code-block:: python

    from pyarrow import Table
    from tradingstrategy.chain import ChainId
    from tradingstrategy.exchange import ExchangeUniverse
    from tradingstrategy.pair import PandasPairUniverse
    from tradingstrategy.pair import HumanReadableTradingPairDescription

    # Exchange map data is so small it does not need any decompression
    exchange_universe: ExchangeUniverse = client.fetch_exchange_universe()

    # Decompress the pair dataset to Python map
    # This is raw PyArrow data
    columnar_pair_table: Table = client.fetch_pair_universe()
    print(f"Total pairs {len(columnar_pair_table)}, total exchanges {len(exchange_universe.exchanges)}")

    # Wrap the data in a helper class with indexes for easier access
    pair_universe = PandasPairUniverse(columnar_pair_table.to_pandas(), exchange_universe=exchange_universe)

    # Get BNB-BUSD pair on PancakeSwap v2
    #
    # There are no fee tiers, so we
    #
    desc: HumanReadableTradingPairDescription = (ChainId.bsc, "pancakeswap-v2", "WBNB", "BUSD")
    bnb_busd = pair_universe.get_pair_by_human_description(desc)
    print(f"We have pair {bnb_busd} with 30d volume of USD {bnb_busd.volume_30d}")

See :ref:`tutorial` section for Pairs tutorial for more information.

@dataclass_json
@dataclass(slots=True)
class DEXPair:
    """ Trading pair information for a single pair.

    Presents a single trading pair on decentralised exchanges.

    DEX trading pairs can be uniquely identified by

    - Internal id.

    - (Chain id, address) tuple - the same address can exist on multiple chains.

    - (Chain slug, exchange slug, pair slug) tuple.

    - Token names and symbols are *not* unique - anyone can create any number of trading pair tickers and token symbols.
      Do not rely on token symbols for anything.

    About data:

    - There is a different between `token0` and `token1` and `base_token` and `quote_token` conventions -
      the former are raw DEX (Uniswap) data while the latter are preprocessed by the server to make the data
      more understandable. Base token is the token you are trading and the quote token is the token you consider
      "money" for the trading. E.g. in WETH-USDC, USDC is the quote token. In SUSHI-WETH, WETH is the quote token.

    - Optional fields may be available if the candle server 1) detected the pair popular enough 2) managed to fetch the third party service information related to the token

    When you download a trading pair dataset from the server, not all trading pairs are available.
    For more information about trading pair availability see :ref:`trading pair tracking <tracking>`.

    The class provides some JSON helpers to make it more usable with JSON based APIs.

    This data class is serializable via `dataclasses-json` methods. Example:

    .. code-block::

        info_as_string = pair.to_json()

    You can also do `__json__()` convention data export:

    .. code-block::

        info_as_dict = pair.__json__()

    .. note ::

        Currently all flags are disabled and will be removed in the future. The historical dataset does not contain any filtering flags,
        because the data has to be filtered prior to download, to keep the download dump in a reasonasble size.
        The current data set of 800k trading pairs produce 100 MB dataset of which most of the pairs
        are useless. The server prefilters trading pairs and thus you cannot access historical data of pairs
        that have been prefiltered.

class PandasPairUniverse:
    """A pair universe implementation that is created from Pandas dataset.

    This is a helper class, as :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` is somewhat more difficult to interact with.
    This class will read the raw data frame and convert it to `DEXPair` objects with a lookup index.
    Because the DEXPair conversion is expensive for 10,000s of Python objects,
    it is recommended that you filter the raw :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` by using filtering functions
    in :py:mod:`tradingstrategy.pair` first, before initializing :py:class:`PandasPairUniverse`.

    About the usage:

    - Single trading pairs can be looked up using :py:meth:`PandasPairUniverse.get_pair_by_smart_contract`
      and :py:meth:`PandasPairUniverse.get_pair_by_id`

    - Multiple pairs can be looked up by directly reading `PandasPairUniverse.df` Pandas dataframe

    Example how to use:

    .. code-block::

        # Get dataset from the server as Apache Pyarrow table
        columnar_pair_table = client.fetch_pair_universe()

        # Convert Pyarrow -> Pandas -> in-memory DEXPair index
        pair_universe = PandasPairUniverse(columnar_pair_table.to_pandas())

        # Lookup SUSHI-WETH trading pair from DEXPair index
        # https://tradingstrategy.ai/trading-view/ethereum/sushi/sushi-eth
        pair: DEXPair = pair_universe.get_pair_by_smart_contract("0x795065dcc9f64b5614c407a6efdc400da6221fb0")

    If the pair index is too slow to build, or you want to keep it lean,
    you can disable the indexing with `build_index`.
    In this case, some of the methods won't work:

    .. code-block::

        # Get dataset from the server as Apache Pyarrow table
        columnar_pair_table = client.fetch_pair_universe()

        # Convert Pyarrow -> Pandas -> in-memory DEXPair index
